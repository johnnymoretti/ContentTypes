the	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
strain	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
on	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
terrific	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

Nor	B-NARRATIVE
do	I-NARRATIVE

it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
seems	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
to	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

argument	I-NARRATIVE
has	I-NARRATIVE
been	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
these	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
races	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
are	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
necessary	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
for	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
development	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

There	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
something	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
this	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
theory	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

perhaps	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
,	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

when	B-DESCRIPTIVE
the	I-DESCRIPTIVE
cars	I-DESCRIPTIVE
are	I-DESCRIPTIVE

But	B-NARRATIVE
in	I-NARRATIVE
such	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
race	I-NARRATIVE
as	I-NARRATIVE
that	I-NARRATIVE
of	I-NARRATIVE
yesterday	I-NARRATIVE
nothing	I-NARRATIVE
is	I-NARRATIVE
proved	I-NARRATIVE

except	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
individual	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

wins	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

lose	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
has	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
a	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
better	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
driver	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

Some	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
weight	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
may	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
be	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
given	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
to	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
argument	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
tests	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
are	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
needed	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
for	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
development	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
product	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
,	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

but	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
tests	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
can	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
be	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
made	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
under	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
absolutely	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
safe	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
conditions	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

A	B-NARRATIVE
car	I-NARRATIVE
may	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
run	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
thousand	I-NARRATIVE
miles	I-NARRATIVE
and	I-NARRATIVE
at	I-NARRATIVE
top	I-NARRATIVE
speed	I-NARRATIVE

without	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
endangering	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
lives	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
dozens	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

other	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
participants	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
race	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

this	I-NARRATIVE
purpose	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
no	I-NARRATIVE
race	I-NARRATIVE

So	B-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
contest	I-NARRATIVE
must	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
considered	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
not	I-NARRATIVE
as	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
practical	I-NARRATIVE
commercial	I-NARRATIVE
test	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
but	I-NARRATIVE
as	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
sport	I-NARRATIVE

And	B-NARRATIVE
thus	I-NARRATIVE
considered	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE

we	B-NARRATIVE
feel	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
must	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
be	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
condemned	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
extreme	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
form	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
took	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
this	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
great	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
race	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

The	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
argument	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
strengthened	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
fact	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
everything	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

better	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
